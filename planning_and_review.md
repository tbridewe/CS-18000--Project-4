Review and Planning Report

Your team must submit a project review and planning document for Project 4. In it, you'll consider lessons learned from Project 4 and document how you will approach Project 5. 

Part One

Part One is a minimum of 500 words and requires the following: 
- Describing your project and the functionality you implemented. Include both required and optional features, along with descriptions of each. 

Part Two
Each team member must write a minimum of 300 words on the following:

- A minimum of 200 words describing your contributions to Project 4. 
- A minimum of 100 words on what you would do differently, if anything, if you were given the opportunity to start over again. If you would do something differently, note how you will apply that knowledge in Project 5. If you would not do anything differently, explain why. 
- Each team member's section should be labelled with that individual's name. 

Part Three
Part Three is a minimum of 400 words and requires the following: 

- A minimum of 200 words describing your collaboration strategy for Project 5, including how work will be assigned and how team members will communicate. 
- A minimum of 100 words containing a list of tasks you believe will be necessary to complete Project 5, along with the individuals assigned to complete them and when they should be done. You may use a list or paragraph for this section. 
  - For example, "Develop Server class" - Completed by 07/26/2021 - Student One. 
  - Note: There must be an even distribution of work among the team members.
- A minimum of 100 words describing your conflict mitigation strategy. What will you do to prevent team conflict? How will you handle disagreements if they do arise? 

Note: Be sure your document does not have any major grammar or structural errors. You are not required to adhere to any writing style guide (for example, APA), but your document should be organized following the guidelines listed above.  You can use the following structure for a general outline: 

- A cover page with the report title and all team member names listed
- A section labelled "Part 1" on a new page with the information described above (including as many pages as necessary). 
- A section labelled "Part 2" on a new page with the information described above (including as many pages as necessary). 
- A section labelled "Part 3" on a new page with the information described above (including as many pages as necessary). 
- We recommend using a 12 point font such as Times New Roman and double spacing. All section and subsection labels should be bolded.
